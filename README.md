Alternatively you can click on the extension icon in the toolbar to toggle it.

### Closing SOmni

### Switching between dark and light mode

The dark and light theme in SOmni is currently tied to your system's theme.

On Mac you can change the theme by clicking on the Apple menu (on the top left), opening the System preferences, going into the General section, and then choosing between dark, light, or auto.

On Windows it depends on the OS version. [Here is a guide for Windows 11 and 10.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-desktop-background-and-colors-176702ca-8e24-393b-15f2-b15b38f69de6#ID0EBF=Windows_11)

After switching the theme you might need to restart Chrome.

### Acknowledgments

This work is highly inspired by [Omni](https://github.com/alyssaxuu/omni) by Alyssa X. This project was originally developed to be a alternative JQuery-less version of Omni, but due to the scope of changes and rewrites the project has become its own development. The project is offered with the same MIT license so that people are free to take optimizations and implement them back into Omni if wanted.
