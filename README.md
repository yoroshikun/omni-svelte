### Closing Omni

### Switching between dark and light mode

The dark and light theme in Omni is tied to your system's theme.

On Mac you can change the theme by clicking on the Apple menu (on the top left), opening the System preferences, going into the General section, and then choosing between dark, light, or auto.

On Windows it depends on the OS version. [Here is a guide for Windows 11 and 10.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-desktop-background-and-colors-176702ca-8e24-393b-15f2-b15b38f69de6#ID0EBF=Windows_11)

After switching the theme you might need to restart Chrome.
