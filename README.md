On Windows it depends on the OS version. [Here is a guide for Windows 11 and 10.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-desktop-background-and-colors-176702ca-8e24-393b-15f2-b15b38f69de6#ID0EBF=Windows_11)

After switching the theme you might need to restart Chrome.

### Acknowledgments

This work is highly inspired by [Omni](https://github.com/alyssaxuu/omni) by Alyssa X. This project was originally developed to be a alternative JQuery-less version of Omni, but due to the scope of changes rewrites and features the project has become its own development. The project is offered with the same MIT license so that people are free to take optimizations and implement them back into Omni if wanted, but I highly recommend you checkout and help this project develop further.
